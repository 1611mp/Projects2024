# Projects2024
All my projects in the year 2024 are uploaded here.

This code is from my first Python Project named SMS Spam Filter
The program is designed to get a input from the user and tell us whether the text contained in the input is a Spam or a Ham message.

I've written this program using google colab and the csv file is integrated with the Google Drive.
I've imported Pandas, NLTK and String libraries to read the csv file and manupulate the code to behave in a certain way.
I've defined three functions to carry out the code to give us an appropriate result.

I hope you will appreciate my work!!
